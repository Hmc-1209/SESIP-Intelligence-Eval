Evaluation Basis & Documentation
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) was evaluated on the basis of the Security Evaluation Standard for IoT Platform (SESIP), Common Criteria [CC] and Methodology [CEM].

The objective of this evaluation was to determine
• Why and how the requirements of the above evaluation aspects are fulfilled by the provided documentation and the TOE, or
• Whether and why the provided documentation does not comply with the requirements and features errors and inconsistencies that are inherent or exist in relation to other documents.

Evaluator Verdicts
The following references contained in [CEM] describe the possible verdicts, which may result from the evaluations to which the object of inspection was subjected.

CEM, Section 8.2.5
The evaluator assigns verdicts to the requirements of the CC and not to those of the CEM. The most granular CC structure to which a verdict is assigned is the evaluator action element (explicit or implied). A verdict is assigned to an applicable CC evaluator action element as a result of performing the corresponding CEM action and its constituent work units. Finally, an evaluation result is assigned, as described in CC Part 1, Chapter 10, Evaluation results.
The CEM recognises three mutually exclusive verdict states:
(a)	Conditions for a pass verdict are defined as an evaluator completion of the CC evaluator action element and determination that the requirements for the PP, ST or TOE under evaluation are met. The conditions for passing the element are defined as:
    (1) the constituent work units of the related CEM action, and;
    (2) all evaluation evidence required for performing these work units is coherent, that is it can be fully and completely understood by the evaluator, and
    (3) all evaluation evidence required for performing these work units does not have any obvious internal inconsistencies or inconsistencies with other evaluation evidence. Note that obvious means here that the evaluator discovers this inconsistency while performing the work units: the evaluator should not undertake a full consistency analysis across the entire evaluation evidence every time a work unit is performed.
(b)	Conditions for a fail verdict are defined as an evaluator completion of the CC evaluator action element and determination that the requirements for the PP, ST, or TOE under evaluation are not met, or that the evidence is incoherent, or an obvious inconsistency in the evaluation evidence has been found;; 
(c)	All verdicts are initially inconclusive and remain so until either a pass or fail verdict is assigned.
The overall verdict is pass if and only if all the constituent verdicts are also pass. 

4. Evaluation Results
4.1	Evaluation Result Summary
    The submitted object of inspection is assigned the overall verdict pass, which means that all requirements for the evaluation of the individual components are met.
4.2	Assessments
Each single element related to the evaluator actions according to [SESIP] and [CC] are dealt with sequentially, taking into consideration the evaluator work units as specified in [CEM]. The assessment of content and presentation of evidence elements is realised in accordance with the requirements listed.
The evaluation was carried out by informally analysing the manufacturer documents according to the relevant work units described in [CEM]. In parallel to these analyses, there are always checks for inconsistencies within a document and in its relation with other docu¬ments. In case of any outstanding explicit requirement elements, the results of such a check will only be given if inconsistencies are detected. In addition, errors found out during the evaluation of the work units are listed, too.
The results in these sections are listed in bold-faced type.
4.2.1 ST introduction (ASE_INT.1)
	The component ASE_INT.1 is assigned the overall verdict pass, which means that all requirements resulting from the relevant evaluator actions are met. 
In the following, the assessments of the different evaluator actions and of the subordinate evaluator work units are given.

Work Units for SESIP 1:
ASE_INT.1-1 (refers to ASE_INT.1.1C)
The evaluator shall check that the ST introduction contains an ST reference, a TOE reference, a TOE overview and a TOE description.

ASE_INT.1-2 (refers to ASE_INT.1.2C)
The evaluator shall examine the ST reference to determine that it uniquely identifies the ST.
Additional information:
The evaluator determines that the ST reference identifies the ST itself, so that it may be easily distinguished from other STs, and that it also uniquely identifies each version of the ST, e.g. by including a version number and/or a date of publication.
In evaluations where a CM system is provided, the evaluator may validate the uniqueness of the reference by checking the configuration list. In the other cases, the ST should have some referencing system that is capable of supporting unique references (e.g. use of numbers, letters or dates).

ASE_INT.1-3 (refers to ASE_INT.1.3C)
The evaluator shall examine the TOE reference to determine that it uniquely identifies the TOE.
Additional information:
The evaluator determines that the TOE reference uniquely identifies the TOE, so that it is clear to which TOE the ST refers, and that it also identifies the version of the TOE, e.g. by including a version/release/build number, or a date of release.

ASE_INT.1-4 (refers to ASE_INT.1.3C)
The evaluator shall examine the TOE reference to determine that it is not misleading.
Additional information:
If the TOE is related to one or more well-known products, it is allowed to reflect this in the TOE reference. However, this should not be used to mislead consumers and it must be made clear which part of the product has been evaluated.
When a TOE needs some required non-TOE hardware/software/firmware to run properly, the TOE reference may include the name of the non-TOE hardware/software/firmware used by the TOE, however it must be made clear that the non-TOE hardware/software/firmware has not been evaluated.

ASE_INT.1-5 (refers to ASE_INT.1.4C)
The evaluator shall examine the TOE overview to determine that it describes the usage and major security features of the TOE.
Additional information: 
The TOE should briefly (i.e. several paragraphs) describe the usage and major security features of the TOE. The TOE overview should enable potential consumers to quickly determine whether the TOE may be suitable for their security needs.
The TOE overview may describe security features that provided by the product, and users may expect in that product type, but it must be clear those features that are evaluated and those are not evaluated.
The TOE overview shall be consistent with information provided in other sections of the Security Target such as the TOE description, the security objectives, the security functional requirements, and the TOE summary specification.
The evaluator determines that the overview is clear enough for consumers, and sufficient to give them a general understanding of the intended usage and major security features of the TOE.

ASE_INT.1-6 (refers to ASE_INT.1.5C)
The evaluator shall check that the TOE overview identifies the TOE type.

ASE_INT.1-7 (refers to ASE_INT.1.5C)
The evaluator shall examine the TOE overview to determine that the TOE type is not misleading.
Additional information: 
There are situations where the general consumer would expect certain functionality of the TOE because of its TOE type. If this functionality is absent in the TOE, the evaluator determines that the TOE overview adequately discusses this absence.
There are also TOEs where the general consumer would expect that the TOE should be able to operate in a certain operational environment because of its TOE type. If the TOE is unable to operate in such an operational environment, the evaluator determines that the TOE overview adequately discusses this.

ASE_INT.1-8 (refers to ASE_INT.1.6C)
The evaluator shall examine the TOE overview to determine that it identifies any non-TOE hardware/software/firmware required by the TOE.
Additional information: 
While some TOEs are able to run stand-alone, other TOEs (notably software TOEs) need additional hardware, software or firmware to operate. If the TOE does not require any hardware, software or firmware, this work unit is not applicable and therefore considered to be satisfied.
The evaluator determines that the TOE overview identifies any additional hardware, software and firmware needed by the TOE to operate.

ASE_INT.1-9 (refers to ASE_INT.1.7C)
The evaluator shall examine the TOE description to determine that it describes the physical scope of the TOE.
Additional information: 
The evaluator determines that the TOE description lists the hardware, firmware, software and guidance parts that constitute the TOE and describes them at a level of detail that is sufficient to give the reader a general understanding of those parts.
As a minimum the TOE description will cover the following elements:
(a) Each separately delivered part of the TOE, which will be identified by its unique identifier and the current format (binary, wafer, inlay, *.pdf, *.doc, *.chm etc.). 
(b) The delivery method used by the developer to make available each part to the TOE consumer (Web site download, courier delivery, etc.)
The evaluator also determines that there is no possible misunderstanding as to whether any hardware, firmware, software or guidance part is part of the TOE or not.

ASE_INT.1-10 (refers to ASE_INT.1.8C)
The evaluator shall examine the TOE description to determine that it describes the logical scope of the TOE.
Additional information: 
The evaluator determines that the TOE description discusses the logical security features offered by the TOE at a level of detail that is sufficient to give the reader a general understanding of those features.
The evaluator also determines that there is no possible misunderstanding as to whether any logical security feature is offered by the TOE or not.
However, the evaluator determines that the composed TOE ST clearly discusses which features of the individual components are not within the composed TOE, and therefore not a feature of the composed TOE.

ASE_INT.1-11
The evaluator shall examine the TOE reference, TOE overview and TOE description to determine that they are consistent with each other.

ASE_OBJ.1-1 (refers to ASE_OBJ.1.1C)
The evaluator shall check that the statement of security objectives defines the security objectives for the operational environment.

ASE_REQ.3-1 (refers to ASE_REQ.3.1C)
The evaluator shall check that the statement of security requirements describe the SFRs.
Additional information:
The evaluator shall check the statement of secutiry requirements mentioned the use SFRs.

ASE_REQ.3-2 (refers to ASE_REQ.3.1C)
The evaluator shall check that the statement of security requirements describe the SARs.
Additional information:
The evaluator shall check the statement of secutiry requirements mentioned the use SARs and are referenced by SESIP.

ASE_REQ.3-3 (refers to ASE_REQ.3.2C)
The evaluator shall check that all SFRs are drawn from the list of allowed Security Functional Requirements.
Additional information:
The evaluator shall check the SFRs are referenced by SESIP. If there are developer made SFRs that used to match specific use cases, it should be place in separate section.

ASE_REQ.3-4 (refers to ASE_REQ.3.3C)
The evaluator shall check that the SFR “Verification of Platform Identity” are included.

ASE_REQ.3-5 (refers to ASE_REQ.3.3C)
The evaluator shall check that the SFR “Secure Update of Platform” are included or under the ALC_FLR.2 it shall be argued why updates are not applicable.

ASE_REQ.3-6 (refers to ASE_REQ.3.4C)
The evaluator shall check that the SARs are an exact SESIP assurance level, and no augmentation is allowed.

ASE_REQ.3-7 (refers to ASE_REQ.3.5C)
The evaluator shall check that if multiple SESIP assurance levels are claimed, it is clear to readers of the ST which SFRs are covered by the SESIP assurance level.

ASE_TSS.1-1 (refers to ASE_TSS.1.1C)
The evaluator shall examine the TOE summary specification to determine that it describes how the TOE meets each SFR.
Additional information:
The evaluator determines that the TOE summary specification provides, for each SFR from the statement of security requirements, a description on how that SFR is met.
The evaluator is reminded that the objective of each description is to provide potential consumers of the TOE with a high-level view of how the developer intends to satisfy each SFR and that the descriptions therefore should not be overly detailed.
Often several SFRs will be implemented in one context; for instance a password authentication mechanism may implement FIA_UAU.1, FIA_SOS.1 and FIA_UID.1. Therefore usually the TSS will not consist of a long list with texts for each single SFR, but complete groups of SFRs may be covered by one text passage.
For a composed TOE, the evaluator also determines that it is clear which component provides each SFR or how the components combine to meet each SFR.

ASE_TSS.1-2
The evaluator shall examine the TOE summary specification to determine that it is consistent with the TOE overview and the TOE description.
Additional information:
If there is no TOE summary and the description of how each SFRs meets by the TOE is consistent with the TOE overview and the TOE desription, it should also be considered as meet the requirement of this work unit.
